# Common Algebra Mistakes

## Quadratic Equations
1. Missing the ± sign in the quadratic formula
2. Using b² + 4ac instead of b² − 4ac
3. Dividing only by 2 instead of 2a
4. Not verifying roots by substitution

## Factoring
1. Forgetting common factors
2. Incorrect sign pairing in trinomials
3. Assuming a² − b² = (a − b)² (incorrect)

## Exponents & Logs
1. aᵐ · aⁿ = aᵐⁿ ❌ (should be aᵐ⁺ⁿ)
2. (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ ❌ (should be aᵐⁿ)
3. log(a + b) = log a + log b ❌
