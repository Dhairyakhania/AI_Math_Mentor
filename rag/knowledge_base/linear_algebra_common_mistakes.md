# Common Linear Algebra Mistakes

1. Assuming matrix multiplication is commutative
2. Finding inverse without checking determinant
3. Assuming det(A + B) = det(A) + det(B)
4. Ignoring determinant changes in row operations
5. Confusing eigenvalues with eigenvectors
6. Forgetting dimension compatibility
