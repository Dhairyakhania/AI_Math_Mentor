# Probability Formulas

## Basic Probability
P(A) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes  
0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1

## Complement
P(A′) = 1 − P(A)

## Addition Rule
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)

If A, B are mutually exclusive:
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)

## Multiplication Rule
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) · P(B | A)

If independent:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) · P(B)

## Conditional Probability
P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

## Bayes’ Theorem
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) · P(A)] / P(B)

## Permutations & Combinations
nPr = n! / (n − r)!  
nCr = n! / [r!(n − r)!]

## Binomial Distribution
P(X = k) = nCk · pᵏ · (1 − p)ⁿ⁻ᵏ
