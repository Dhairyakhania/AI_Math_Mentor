# Quadratic Equations

## Standard Form
ax² + bx + c = 0

## Quadratic Formula
x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a

## Discriminant (D = b²-4ac)
- D > 0: Two distinct real roots
- D = 0: One repeated real root  
- D < 0: Two complex conjugate roots

## Vieta's Formulas
For ax² + bx + c = 0 with roots α and β:
- Sum of roots: α + β = -b/a
- Product of roots: αβ = c/a

## Factoring Patterns
- Difference of squares: a² - b² = (a+b)(a-b)
- Perfect square: a² + 2ab + b² = (a+b)²
- Sum of cubes: a³ + b³ = (a+b)(a²-ab+b²)
- Difference of cubes: a³ - b³ = (a-b)(a²+ab+b²)

# Common Mistakes in Algebra

1. **Sign errors**: Forgetting to distribute negative signs
2. **Quadratic formula**: Missing the ± symbol, giving only one root
3. **Domain restrictions**: Forgetting that denominators cannot be zero
4. **Square roots**: Forgetting ± when solving x² = k
5. **Exponent rules**: Incorrectly adding exponents when multiplying bases
6. **Factoring**: Not checking if factors can be simplified further
